# Titanic Dataset Visualization and EDA  

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and creating visualizations for the Titanic dataset using Python. The goal was to clean the data, explore relationships between variables, and identify key patterns and trends.

---

## Features  
- **Data cleaning**:  
  - Handling missing values.  
  - Dropping irrelevant columns.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**:  
  - Distribution of numerical features.  
  - Survival analysis based on gender, class, and age.  
- **Visualizations**:  
  - Histograms and bar charts.  
  - Correlation heatmaps.  
  - Survival trends and more.  

---

## Tools and Libraries  
- **Python**: Programming language.  
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Data visualization.  
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.  

---

## Insights  
- **Survival Rates**: Women and passengers in higher classes had higher survival chances.  
- **Age Distribution**: Most passengers were aged 20-40.  
- **Correlation**: Class and gender were significant factors affecting survival.
